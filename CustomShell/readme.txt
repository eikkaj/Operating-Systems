First attempt at creating my own basic shell in c. Having no experience with C, or even C++, this assignment was challenging and there is a lot 
that I plan to fix in the future. 

Known Issues: 
exit does not always exit
only programs located in /bin are able to be run

Future plans:
pipes
background execution
